'''
The database management module maintains records contained in the database.
Depending on how large or complex a database becomes, this may be divided up
into sub-modules arranged by table.

TODO:
    - Instead of returning simply booleans, return messages that indicate
      how or why something failed/succeeded.
    - Add handlers for different database types (SQLite, MySQL, etc.)
        - Can SQLAlchemy be used for this task?  Is it thread-safe?
    - Sanitize strings better.
